    "Excellent - now we've removed links and the word \"Reuters\" from our corpus. Next, let's tokenize the corpus. Tokenization is important because it will ultimately allow us to vectorize our corpus, which is necessary for modeling. From visually examining this corpus, it appears that a fair number of the \"fake\" news articles have spelling issues that could lead to the creation of features that aren't useful for our modeling (e.g. missing apostrophes in contractions that would lead to the creation of meaningless one- or two- character tokens). There are also quite a few punctuation characters that were not captured as part of the cleaning above that need to be removed.\n",

Instead of just counting the instances of each term like the frequency distribution above, the TF-IDF vectorizer will assign each token a weight that represent the importance of each term in the document being analyzed. This will be important for helping us to analyze which words are most predictive of real vs. fake news later. If a term has the highest value of all the words for one document, that would mean that it appears frequently in the document and is relatively rare in the entire corpus, making it an important term for identifying the class of document."

    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we've been using a TF-IDF vectorizer to assign weights to words based on their presence (and rarity) across each individual document and the entire corpus. For this next model, we'll use [Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) from the Stanford NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), which is a pre-trained set of 50-dimensional word vectors for 6 billion words. While the TF-IDF vectorizer is trained only on the words in this corpus, the GloVe vectors are trained on a massive quantity of text data and uses word co-occurrences to understand the relationships between words. To start, we'll need to construct a vocabulary of the unique words in our corpus:"
